Project 29, part three

This game takes techniques you’ve learned previously – not least SpriteKit, physics, and Core Graphics – and stitches 
them together into something new, something clever, and something fun.

This says a lot about the amount of progress you’ve made: you ought to be able to go through every line of code in the 
project and explain what its purpose is, which would have been impossible a few months ago. But it also gets right to the 
heart of programming: it’s a creative process - we’re not just flipping bits in a CPU and hoping for the best, but using 
the skills we’ve learned to design, to innovate, and to bring something new into the world.

Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineer at Apple, once said “people sometimes have a view of 
programming that is something solitary and very technical, but programming is among the most creative, expressive, 
and social careers.”

As we approach the end of this course, I hope you’ll keep those words in mind. As I’ve said countless times before: 
programming is an art, so don’t spend all your time sharpening your pencil when you should be drawing.

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 29, complete its review, then work through all three of 
its challenges.



---------- Wrap up

This was a huge project, and gave you lots to learn about mixing UIKit and SpriteKit, texture atlases, scene transitions, 
and of course destructible terrain – while also giving you another real-world project under your belt.

This project should also have shown you how you can bring skills together to make something bigger and better: Core 
Graphics and physics combined to make destructible terrain, and really it wasn’t that hard!

Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try 
your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Add code and UI to track the player scores across levels, then make the game end after one player has won three times.

2. Add Auto Layout rules for the UI components in our storyboard, allowing them to remain positioned neatly regardless 
of which iPad size is used.

3. Use the physics world’s gravity to add random wind to each level, making sure to add a label telling players the 
direction and strength.
