Project 19, part two

Yesterday we did a lot of set up work, but now it’s time for the pay off: we’re going to send custom JavaScript code back 
to Safari and have it executed, giving our (hypothetical!) users the ability to manipulate web pages right on their phone.

I’m not going to pretend that Apple’s actions API is pleasant, and I’m certainly not going to argue that you need to like 
using JavaScript. As Jeremy Foster once said, “every developer loves and hates JavaScript a little bit” – it’s something 
we all need to be aware of, and perhaps even be able to write to some level, but it’s by no means required.

The point of this project isn’t to teach you JavaScript, but instead to show you what’s possible with iOS. 
The overwhelming majority of iPhone owners use Safari, and in just two days you’ll have finished building an app that 
adds functionality directly to it – what common problems can you solve?

Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about UITextView, NotificationCenter, and more.
