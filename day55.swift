Project 14, part one 


Ezra Koenig said “some people say video games rot your brain, but I think they work different muscles that maybe you don't
normally use.” By now you should know I believe that idea extends further: making video games works different muscles 
that you wouldn’t otherwise use making apps or similar.

Yes, you might decide making games is what you want to do on iOS, and maybe you’ll even be lucky enough to get into 
Apple’s Arcade program. Of course, you’re also just as likely to decide that your goal is to make apps, but even then 
the skills you learn making games will prove useful.

In this project, the skills include loops, masking, GCD, and more – all the kinds of things you can use regardless of 
whether you decide games are for you. And of course the deeper skill is learning how to structure Swift to solve problems 
– practicing the art of understanding code flow across larger projects.

So, whether or not you decide to make games in the future, there’s lots to learn in this project!

Today you have three topics to work through, and you’ll learn about SKCropNode, SKTexture, and more.
