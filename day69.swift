Project 19, part three

You’ve modified Safari! Apple’s web browser has been there since the very first iPhone, and now you’ve hooked your own 
code directly into it. You’ll be taking on a few challenges today to encourage you to think of ways to use your new-found 
power, but I hope you can immediately realize the potential here – even a small improvement can make a difference to 
millions of people.

I know this project was hard, but I have some bad news for you: tomorrow’s game is also hard. But as Kimberly Guilfoyle 
said, “through determination and self-focus and discipline, you can accomplish anything.”

Stick with it! Things get easier after the next game, but your skillset continues to expand rapidly.

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 19, complete its review, then work through all three of 
its challenges.
