Project 19, part three

You’ve modified Safari! Apple’s web browser has been there since the very first iPhone, and now you’ve hooked your own 
code directly into it. You’ll be taking on a few challenges today to encourage you to think of ways to use your new-found 
power, but I hope you can immediately realize the potential here – even a small improvement can make a difference to 
millions of people.

I know this project was hard, but I have some bad news for you: tomorrow’s game is also hard. But as Kimberly Guilfoyle 
said, “through determination and self-focus and discipline, you can accomplish anything.”

Stick with it! Things get easier after the next game, but your skillset continues to expand rapidly.

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 19, complete its review, then work through all three of 
its challenges.



---------- Wrap up

I'll tell you what: I'm feeling tired and I didn't even have to learn anything to write this project – I can't imagine 
how tired you are! But please don't be too disheartened: this project builds the the bridge between JavaScript and Swift, 
and now that bridge is built you can add your own Swift functionality on top.

Some of the code isn't pleasant to work with, and certainly I wish iOS would just figure out text view insets 
automatically for keyboards, but you're through it now so your project is done. Even though this was a hard project, 
I did cut quite a few corners to make the code as easy as possible, so again I want to encourage you to try creating 
another extension and see how Apple's example code is different from mine.

Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try 
your new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Add a bar button item that lets users select from a handful of prewritten example scripts, shown using a 
UIAlertController – at the very least your list should include the example we used in this project.

2. You're already receiving the URL of the site the user is on, so use UserDefaults to save the user's JavaScript 
for each site. You should convert the URL to a URL object in order to use its host property.

3. For something bigger, let users name their scripts, then select one to load using a UITableView.
