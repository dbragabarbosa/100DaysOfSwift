Project 15, part two


I hope you can agree that animation in iOS is almost invisible – we just lay out all the changes we want to happen, and 
Core Animation figures out all the intermediate steps to make it happen.

As I’ve said several times, animation is more than about making our software look good – it has a functional purpose too, 
ensuring that users understand why things and changing and what states they are moving from and to.

Larry Niven once said, “that's the thing about people who think they hate computers – what they really hate is lousy 
programmers.” Folks paid a lot of money for their iPhones and iPads, and Apple’s software oozes polish and refinement – 
if you don’t put a similar level of care into your own code then your app will stick out, and not in a good way.

So, with today’s challenges you need to apply your new animation knowledge to the projects you’ve made previously. 
I think you’ll be pleased how easy it is, and I hope also inspired to take on more animations in the future!

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 15, complete its review, then work through all three of 
its challenges.
