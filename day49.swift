Project 12, part two

Alan Perlis once said “fools ignore complexity; pragmatists suffer it; some can avoid it; geniuses remove it.” Today you’re 
going to see that in Swift code: rather than try to simplify the code for NSCoding, the Swift team found a way to remove it 
entirely using the Codable protocol.

Sometimes you won’t have a choice and need to use NSCoding, but where possible Codable is both easier and safer to use. 
You do need to know them both, though, and by seeing them both used to solve the same problem hopefully you’ll able to 
decide for yourself which you prefer.

Before you get down to work, here’s another fun Swift in-joke for you: sometimes you might see T-shirts with a picture of a 
fish followed by “able”, but before you scratch your head wondering what “fishable” might mean please remember that “COD” 
is a type of fish!

Today you should work through the Codable chapter and wrap up for project 12, complete its review, then work through all 
three of its challenges.
