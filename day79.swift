Project 23, part three

With that monster project finished, there are four things you need to do:

1. Feel smug that you made an awesome game.

2. Play that awesome game and post your best scores on social media.

3. Complete the review for project 23.

4. Complete all three challenges

At this point in the 100 days there’s a good chance you’re feeling tired, and might even be tempted to skip a few of these 
challenges. I hope you don’t, though – these challenges are here to help stretch you a little, and to make sure you’re able 
to apply what you learned in a new context.

Shigeru Miyamoto – the legendary Japanese game designer who gave us Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, and more – once said “to 
create a new standard, you have to be up for that challenge and really enjoy it.” That’s the goal here: every time you 
dive into a challenge and get it solved, you’re leveling up your Swift skills, and setting a new standard for what you 
can do in the future.

Trust me: by the time you’ve finished these 100 days and completed all the challenges, all the milestones, and all the 
reviews, the standard you’ll be working to will be unrecognizably different from where you were on day 1 – you’re doing 
a great job!

Today you should work through the wrap up chapter for project 23, complete its review, then work through all three of 
its challenges.



---------- Wrap up

You've just finished a massive project, and regardless of how much you have learned you deserve kudos for all your patience. 
This project required you to follow several long steps before you could see your code run. I hope it was worth it, and 
I hope in retrospect that you can see why all the code was needed.

Along the way, you've learned all about SKShapeNode, AVAudioPlayer, physics speed, CaseIterable, removeFirst(), action 
groups, and more, so you're several steps closer to your goal of being an experienced Swift developer. Well done!


Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try your 
new knowledge to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

1. Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, 
giving them useful names.

2. Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.

3. Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.
